# Android Take Home Test

### **Android Take-Home Test: Weather Tracker**

### **Objective**

Build a weather app that demonstrates your skills in **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, and **clean architecture**. The app should allow users to search for a city, display its weather on the home screen, and persist the selected city across launches. Follow the **Figma designs** closely and integrate data from **WeatherAPI.com**.

---

### **Task Description**

1. **Home Screen**:
    - Displays weather for a single **saved city**, including:
        - City name.
        - Temperature.
        - Weather condition (with corresponding icon from the API).
        - Humidity (%).
        - UV index.
        - "Feels like" temperature.
    - If no city is saved, prompt the user to search.
    - **Search bar** for querying new cities.
2. **Search Behavior**:
    - Show a **search result card** for the queried city.
    - Tapping the result updates the Home Screen with the city’s weather and persists the selection.
3. **Local Storage**:
    - Use **SharedPreferences**, **DataStore**, or equivalent to persist the selected city.
    - Reload the city’s weather on app launch.

### **API Integration**

- Use **WeatherAPI.com** to fetch weather data:
    - ⭐️ 🔗 API Documentation: [WeatherAPI Documentation](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/). 🔗 ⭐️
    - Free tier includes current weather data with:
        - **Temperature**.
        - **Weather condition** (including an icon URL).
        - **Humidity (%).**
        - **UV index.**
        - **Feels like** temperature.

### **Requirements**

1. **Tech Stack**:
    - Use **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** exclusively.
    - Follow **MVVM architecture** with modular, testable code.
    - Use **dependency injection** (e.g., Koin, Hilt) and interface-based abstractions.
2. **API**:
    - Fetch weather data using WeatherAPI.com.
    - Handle errors gracefully (e.g., invalid cities, no network).
3. **UI**:
    - ⭐️ 🔗 Match the **Figma designs** [here](https://www.figma.com/design/0zySCKWbyeRO805ifaz1lr/Weather-App-Test-Task?node-id=0-1). 🔗 ⭐️
    - Ensure visual consistency (**95% accuracy**).
4. **Time**:
    - This task should take **no more than 5 hours**. Please stop after 5 hours so that not only do you not overwork yourself but we get a feel for your speed.

### **Submission**

1. Send [amin@10fc.tech](mailto:amin@10fc.tech) an email and provide a public **GitHub repo** with:
    - Complete source code.
    - Setup instructions in the README.
2. Questions? Feel free to reach out for clarification.

### **Evaluation Criteria**

1. **Architecture & Code Quality**:
    - Clean, modular, and testable code.
    - Proper separation of concerns (MVVM).
2. **Local Storage**:
    - Reliable persistence of the selected city.
3. **Networking**:
    - Smooth API integration and error handling.
4. **UI/UX**:
    - Matches Figma designs and feels intuitive.
    - Includes all required weather details (e.g., icons, humidity, UV index, "feels like").
